"""
    This file contains a script to filter maxar patches. It creates a new 'maxar_filtered_patches' folder
    containing all patches from the 'maxar_patches' folder. Files are saved in two folders: 'post' and 'pre',
    each containing patches from the post and pre disaster images respectively. Any pre-image should have its
    corresponding post-image in the 'post' folder. The script uses ThreadPoolExecutor to filter patches in
    parallel.
